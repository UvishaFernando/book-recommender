## 🧠 Overview

**Semantic Book Recommender** is an intelligent, interactive recommendation engine that goes beyond simple keyword matching. Instead of searching titles or tags, it understands the **meaning** behind your query and the **emotional tone** you're looking for — then finds books that actually fit.

> 👉 Goal: Combine semantic vector search, zero-shot classification, and sentiment analysis into a single, easy-to-use recommendation dashboard.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Traditional book search relies on:

- Exact keyword or title matches
- Manually tagged genres and categories
- No sense of tone, mood, or emotional fit

### 💥 Real-World Impact

- Readers struggle to describe *what they want* in searchable terms
- Great matches get missed because the wording doesn't line up
- No way to filter by how a book *feels* (suspenseful, heartwarming, dark, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Search books by the **meaning** of a free-text description, not just keywords
- Classify books into clean, simplified categories
- Score each book's emotional tone across 7 dimensions
- Let users filter and browse recommendations by category and mood
- Present everything through a clean, interactive web dashboard

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔍 Semantic Vector Search
- Powered by HuggingFace embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and ChromaDB
- Describe what you want to read in plain language — matches are found by **plot meaning**, not exact words

### 🎭 Emotional Tone Filtering
- Uses `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base` to score every book description across 7 emotions
- Filter recommendations by tone: *Happy, Sad, Surprising, Angry, Suspenseful,* and more

### 🗂️ Category Classification
- Groups books into simplified, distinct categories for easy browsing
- Removes noisy, overlapping genre tags from the raw dataset

### 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard
- Sleek, glass-themed web interface built entirely in Python with Gradio
- No frontend code required — search, filter, and explore results in one view

## 🔥 What Makes This Project Stand Out

This is **not** just a keyword search tool. It's a full semantic recommendation pipeline:

- ✅ Real vector embeddings for meaning-based search — not string matching
- ✅ Multi-model NLP pipeline (embeddings + classification + emotion scoring)
- ✅ Clean separation between data prep (notebooks) and the live app (dashboard)
- ✅ Emotion-aware filtering — a rare feature in typical recommender projects
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline: data exploration → classification → sentiment scoring → live search
